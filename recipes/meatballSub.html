<ol> 
  <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
  <li> Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, 
    parsley, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until 
    well combined. Shape mixture into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.
  </li>
  <li> Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 
    20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should 
    read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
  <li> While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and 
    open like a book. Remove and discard remove some of the bread from the 
    inside to make a well for the meatballs. Brush with olive oil and season 
    with garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and 
    with the oiled sides facing up.</li>
  <li> When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the baguette into the 
    oven and cook until lightly toasted.</li>
  <li> Meanwhile, warm spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat. </li>
  <li> Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them 
    to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with sauce.</li>
  <li> Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling 
    meatballs in the well. Top with slices of provolone cheese.</li>
  <li> Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
  <li> Cool slightly, then cut into 4 sandwiches.</li>
