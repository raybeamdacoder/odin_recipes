    <h3> Simple, fun, and Tasty!</h3>

    <p> A classic cheese pizza is the ultimate crowd-pleaser. The delicious 
      combination of crispy pizza crust, flavorful tomato sauce, and bubbly 
      cheese make for an unbeatable combination. Even if you're a fan of unique 
      toppings, it's hard to resist a slice of a plain cheese pie! Ree Drummond 
      has all sorts of fun pizzas on the menu at P-Town Pizza in Pawhuska,
      Oklahoma, like fig-arugula and potato-leek. But she made sure to have a 
      classic cheese pizza in the mix, too—and it's a fan favorite. Keep reading 
      to get the recipe. A good classic cheese pizza starts with a good basic 
      pizza dough—and it's not hard to make your own. Once you know your way 
      around homemade pizza dough, making your own pizza is easy. Of course you 
      can always use store-bought dough like Ree does for her Sausage and
      Peppers Pizza or Steakhouse Pizza, or you can use flatbread like she 
      does for these Broccoli and Tomato Pizzas. But if you want to make the 
      ultimate classic cheese pizza, be sure to try the recipe below from 
      P-Town Pizza!</p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> 1 cup of pizza sauce </li>
      <li> 8 oz. of thinly sliced provolone cheese </li>
      <li> 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheeese </li>
      <li> 6 tbsp. of grated parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> The steps </h3>

    <ol> 
      <li> After you've made the dough, divide it in half and let it reach room 
        temperature for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or 
        an inverted baking sheet on the oven floor and preheat to 500˚.</li>
      <li> On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out 1 piece of dough 
        into a 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Dust a pizza peel or 
        another inverted baking sheet with cornmeal and lay the dough 
        on top.</li>
      <li> Spread half of the sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border 
        around the edge. Top with half of the provolone, then with half each of
        the mozzarella and parmesan.</li>
      <li> Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until 
        the crust is browned and the cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat
        with the remaining dough and toppings. Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.</li>
    </ol>
